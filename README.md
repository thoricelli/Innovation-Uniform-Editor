<b>!! REWORK NEEDED !!</b><br>
Currently, this program *can* be used for simple uniforms.<br>
I was working on a shade editor, and other features, but I lost motivation to do so.<br>
Plus this code is quite the spaghetti code I'm NOT gonna lie.<br>
Anyways, DO not hesitate to submit a pull request if you want to help! I could really use it...<br>
Thank you.<br>
Anyways, next task is to refactor this shitty code...<br><br>
